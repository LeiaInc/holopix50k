    <b><i>Abstract.</i></b> With the mass-market adoption of dual-camera mobile phones, leveraging stereo information in computer vision has 
    become increasingly important. Current state-of-the-art methods utilize learning-based algorithms, where the 
    amount and quality of training samples heavily influence results. Existing stereo image datasets are limited 
    either in size or subject variety. Hence, algorithms trained on such datasets do not generalize well to scenarios 
    encountered in mobile photography. We present Holopix50k, a novel in-the-wild stereo image dataset, comprising 49,368 
    image pairs contributed by users of the Holopix™ mobile social platform. In this work, we describe our data collection 
    process and statistically compare our dataset to other popular stereo datasets. We experimentally show that using our 
    dataset significantly improves results for tasks such as stereo super-resolution and self-supervised monocular depth 
    estimation. Finally, we showcase practical applications of our dataset to motivate novel works and use cases.
